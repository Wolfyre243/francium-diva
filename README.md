# Welcome!
This is yet another submodule of Project Francium. Here, I will be working on a python server solely for TTS purposes.
I have plans to integrate this together with francium sigma, as it would only be logical to have only one server instead of two.

There will be a slightly huge learning curve for me, because I have 0 experience in python ðŸ’€.
However, I'm sure hugging face has my back, and all I gotta do is dockerise everything for the Francium ecosystem.
